        <p>
            Welcome to mediwatch! Step into our world of medicine monitoring system. In each medicine we put important labels to it, that includes the generic and brand name, drug class, which you can know what medicine if for. Also, we put prices and dosage to it. 
            
            In addition we put a history to track our activities like, if how much or what medicine we dispensed, or how many or what medicine where added.
            Here, you can easily see the important information to each medication!</p>
